# N741: Linear and logistic regression models

N741 Lecture on Linear and Logistic Regression Modeling - given on 02/08/2017

For this lecture/R lab exercises we will continue to work with the CMC contraceptive method dataset we've worked with the past few weeks. However, the dataset has been updated slightly - some missing data is now present and there are also a few outliers to deal with.
